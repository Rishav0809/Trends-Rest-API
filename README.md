# NewsApplication

- This flutter application, makes use of the material library to create the User Interface for the mobile application.
- It also makes use of <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a>, to fetch the top head-lines for a particular keyword, as entered by the user.
- Furthermore, it fetches the currently on trending google search keywords, from the google trends API. 

#### Description
The user enters a keyword, and once he/she presses the search button, an HTTP GET request is sent to the NewsAPI provider, and once the data is fetched, the details are displayed on the next page. While the data is being fetched, the user gets to see a loading screen. Upon clicking on the previous or next arrow, the next news article related to the searched keyword is displayed.
